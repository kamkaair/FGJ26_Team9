    mc "Wait... Is the mask talking to me??"
    "[mc_color] yelps."

    mk "Yes, I'm talking to you! And now, as a show of my gratitude for saving me from my predicament, I'm giving you my powers! Use them well..."

    mc "What powers?"

    "Time passes on. Despite their struggling, the mask isn't budging."

    mc "Okay. So... I got hit by a truck, I don't know where I am and I have a sometimes-talking-but-usually-not mask glued to my face now? What is this, a bad anime plot?"
