    "Protagonist-kun opens their eyes. They seem to have been transported on to a generic fantasy road, next to a generic fantasy field."

    mc "Ow ow ow... What the hell was that?" 
    "As Protagonist-kun dusts off his pants, he notices something on the ground."

    mc "What's that? A mask?"
    "They pick it up. It starts speaking to them."

    "As Protagonist-kun puts the mask on their generic face, they feel a sudden rush of power surging through their body!" 

    mk "Thank you for picking me up. I have been stuck on the side of this road for far too long..."

    mc "Wait... Is the mask talking to me??"
    "Protagonist-kun yelps."

    mk "Yes, I'm talking to you! And now, as a show of my gratitude for saving me from my predicament, I'm giving you my powers! Use them well..."

    mc "Your... powers?"
    "Protagonist-kun asks."
    "The mask stays silent."
    mc "What powers?"

    "No matter how much they prod, the mask stays silent"

    mc "Fine then! See if I care! I'm leaving you here, you stupid mask!"
    "Unfortunately, for our Protagonist-kun... They can't get the mask off."

    mc "What the hell?!?! Did this thing get super glued to my face???"
    "Time passes on. Despite their struggling, the mask isn't budging."

    mc "Okay. So... I got hit by a truck, I don't know where I am and I have a sometimes-talking-but-usually-not mask glued to my face now? What is this, a bad anime plot?"

    mc "Ugh, I do not want to walk that long in this heat!"
    "Grumbling, they start walking towards the nearest town..."
